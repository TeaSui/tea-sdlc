# Changelog

## 2.0.0 — 2026-11-10

### Breaking
- Subagents consolidated 17 → 12:
  - `devops-engineer-subagent` + `aws-infrastructure-subagent` → `platform-engineer-subagent`
  - `ai-engineer-subagent` → merged into `backend-engineer-subagent`
  - `growth-marketer-subagent` → merged into `business-analyst-subagent` (measurement mode, `measurement.md`)
  - `api-test-agent` → merged into `qa-subagent` (Phase 2b live API validation)
  - `agent-orchestrator` → skill `orchestrating-multi-domain-work`, run by the main session (no nested subagents)
- Project documentation paths unified under `references/documentation-layout.md`: change specs in `docs/specs/<feature>/`, ADRs in `docs/adr/`, living reference docs in `docs/*.md`. Role folders (`docs/requirements/`, `docs/security/`, `docs/contracts/`, `docs/design/`, `docs/domain/`) are read as legacy only.

### Changed
- Model/effort per agent follow `references/model-guide.md`: Opus for tech-lead, security and code review; Sonnet for implementers, BA, UI/UX and QA; Haiku for codebase mapping.
- `/generate-service-docs` and `/upgrade-service-docs` share the canonical layout, never touch `specs/`, `adr/`, `plans/` or legacy folders, and `/upgrade-service-docs` owns spec promotion.
- Bundled files are referenced via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` (agents, commands, skills) or plugin-root-relative paths (rules, references) instead of `~/.claude/`. Planning templates are bundled under `templates/planning/` and `references/planning/`.
- `scripts/check-setup.py` rewritten as the plugin validator (manifests, frontmatter, bundled references, SessionStart contract).
